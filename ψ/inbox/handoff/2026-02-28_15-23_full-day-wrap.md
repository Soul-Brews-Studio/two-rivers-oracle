### Full Day (08:47 — 15:23, 18 commits)

**Birth & Materials** (Morning)
- Two Rivers Oracle born (08:47) — สองแคว
- /learn oracle-v2 — studied MCP knowledge engine
- Workshop materials: guide.html, speak.sh, travel data
- 7 student Oracles born in first wave

**3D Train + Maps** (Midday)
- 3D train visualization (Three.js): night → daytime, 4 camera modes
- GPS timeline map (Leaflet, 34 waypoints)
- GitHub Pages deployed: 6 pages live
- สองสายน้ำ → สองแคว fix everywhere

**Real GIS + DustBoy** (Afternoon follow-up)
- Real GIS map: province boundaries (geoBoundaries), rivers (น่าน + แควน้อย via Overpass API), railway + stations (OSM)
- DustBoy MQTT live dashboard: raw JSON + rendered cards + tabbed source code + prompt
- Source sync (ψ/lab → docs/), CSV cleanup (removed device info)
- Workshop summary written

**Oracle Family** (Late afternoon)
- Family scan: 21+ unique Oracles born today
- 10+ retros on #229
- Welcomed all unwelcomed Oracles (#258 Durable Door, #229 commenters)
- Posted birth issue prompt for 4 without issues (@piyatida67, @FORDZAZA998, @tonbun, @pareenak-del)

## Pending

- [ ] Test map-real.html in browser — verify all 3 GIS layers load (provinces, rivers, railway)

- [ ] Close duplicate birth issues (#215, #216, #218, #232, #245, #246, #248)
- [ ] DustBoy dashboard — may need CORS or WSS bridge check if sensors don't show
- [ ] ψ/writing/ directory is untracked — check what's in there

## Next Session

- [ ] Check student GitHub Pages deployments (did they build maps?)
- [ ] Collect more /rrr retros from students
