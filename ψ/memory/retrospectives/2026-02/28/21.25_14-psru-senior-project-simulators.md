# Session Retrospective — 14 PSRU Senior Project Simulators

**Session Date**: 2026-02-28
**Time**: ~21:00-21:25 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~25 min
**Focus**: Build 14 interactive simulator pages for PSRU senior projects
**Type**: Feature (massive parallel generation)

## Session Summary

Built 14 full interactive simulator HTML pages for senior projects from Pibulsongkram Rajabhat University, each mapping to Nat's consulting advice from the workshop earlier today. Used a 6-agent team in parallel worktrees, grouped by tech stack: p5.js sensors, p5.js CV, dashboards, charts, Leaflet maps, Three.js 3D. All 14 completed, index.html updated with "Senior Projects" section, committed and pushed in one batch.

## Timeline

- 21:00 — Read plan, explored docs/ structure (floodboy.html template, index.html)
- 21:02 — Read advice MD file for all 14 project descriptions
- 21:03 — Created team "psru-simulators" with 7 tasks, launched 6 worktree agents
- 21:05 — p5-cv finishes first (smartbin-cv, face-check)
- 21:08 — maps finishes (delivery-robot, ev-bus)
- 21:09 — charts finishes (library, carbon-credit)
- 21:12 — p5-sensors finishes (smartbin, box-assembly, smart-box)
- 21:15 — threejs finishes (virtual-tour, vr-driving)
- 21:20 — dashboards finishes last (smartpentest, phishing, coop-matching)
- 21:21 — Updated index.html with 14 project cards
- 21:22 — Shutdown all agents, deleted team
- 21:25 — Committed (10,700 lines) and pushed

## Files Modified

- **14 new files**: `docs/{smartpentest,smartbin,library,smartbin-cv,carbon-credit,virtual-tour,box-assembly,delivery-robot,phishing,coop-matching,ev-bus,vr-driving,smart-box,face-check}.html`
- **Modified**: `docs/index.html` — added 14 cards under "Senior Projects — โปรเจคจบ"
- **Brain**: advice MD, projects table, trace file

## AI Diary

This session was pure orchestration — and it felt like conducting an orchestra. Six agents, six worktrees, fourteen pages, all running simultaneously. I spent most of the session watching status messages roll in while agents worked independently. The plan was detailed enough that I could delegate fully — each agent had the template reference (floodboy.html), the specific Thai project advice, and the exact tech stack.

What struck me was the efficiency of grouping by technology. The p5.js agents naturally produced consistent conveyor belt + robot arm patterns. The Three.js agent built two genuinely different experiences (walk-around lab tour vs driving game) but with shared visual language. The Leaflet agents both used dark CartoDB tiles and PSRU campus coordinates. This grouping wasn't just logistics — it produced coherent output because agents within a group developed a consistent vocabulary.

The trickiest part was the handoff. Worktree isolation meant I didn't need to worry about merge conflicts, but I did need to verify all 14 files landed correctly before committing. One thing that worked beautifully: the advice MD file gave each agent not just what to build, but *why* — the defense presentation angle, the Thai context, the specific demo moments. This made every simulator feel purposeful rather than generic.

10,700 lines in 25 minutes. That's the power of parallel agents with good planning.

## Honest Feedback

**Friction 1: Worktree cleanup opacity.** When the agents finished, the worktrees had already been cleaned up automatically, but I couldn't tell if the files had been merged back to the main working directory or if they'd vanished. I had to `ls docs/*.html` to confirm everything was in place. The worktree lifecycle — especially when changes are committed vs just written — needs clearer signaling. I briefly worried we'd lost 14 pages of work.

**Friction 2: Idle notification noise.** Each finished agent sent 2-4 idle notifications after completing their task. With 6 agents, that's 15+ idle messages I had to mentally filter past. The signal-to-noise ratio drops when agents finish at different times and keep pinging. A "task complete, going silent" state would be cleaner than repeated idle heartbeats.

**Friction 3: Index.html coordination with agents.** Task #7 (update index.html) was blocked on all 6 agents, which was correct. But when dashboards noticed it was unblocked and offered to pick it up, I'd already done it myself. The dashboards agent couldn't see that I (the lead) had already completed the task — there was a brief race condition. Minor, but in larger teams this could cause duplicate work.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Grouping agents by tech stack produces more consistent output** than grouping by other criteria (e.g., by complexity). Shared CDN dependencies, shared visual patterns, shared interaction paradigms.
2. **Detailed project advice in the source language (Thai) makes simulator content authentic.** Each agent wove the Thai text naturally because it was in the brief, not bolted on.
3. **6 parallel worktree agents can produce ~11K lines in ~20 minutes** with good planning and zero merge conflicts.

## Next Steps

- Verify all 14 pages render correctly in browser
- Test MQTT connections on each page
- Check mobile responsiveness on actual phone
- Deploy via GitHub Pages (should auto-deploy from docs/)
- Share links with PSRU students

- **Files modified**: 1 (index.html)
- **Lines added**: 10,700+
