# Session Retrospective — Follow-up: Real GIS Map + Cleanup

**Session Date**: 2026-02-28
**Time**: ~14:22 — 14:41 GMT+7
**Duration**: ~20 min
**Focus**: Post-workshop follow-up — code sync, real map, workshop summary
**Type**: Feature + Cleanup

## Session Summary

Follow-up session after the PSRU workshop afternoon wrap. Executed the handoff plan: synced source files, cleaned up data, built a real GIS map with province boundaries and rivers, and created a comprehensive workshop summary. Discovered the workshop grew massively since the afternoon break — from 8 Oracles to 20+, and from 0 retros to 10+.

## Timeline

| Time | Action |
|------|--------|
| 14:22 | Read handoff, assessed current state |
| 14:25 | Synced ψ/lab source with docs/ (daytime theme) |
| 14:26 | Removed old CSV with device info (travel-phitsanulok.csv) |
| 14:28 | Researched real GIS data — provinces, rivers, railway |
| 14:32 | Built docs/map-real.html with real geographic data |
| 14:35 | Updated index.html with new map link |
| 14:37 | Counted Oracle births — 20+ unique! |
| 14:39 | Counted retros on #229 — 10 student posts! |
| 14:40 | Created workshop summary |

## Files Modified

- `docs/map-real.html` — NEW: Real GIS map with province boundaries, rivers (แม่น้ำน่าน + แควน้อย), railway lines, all from live OpenStreetMap data
- `docs/index.html` — Added map-real.html link, renamed original map card
- `ψ/lab/github-pages-workshop/travel-3d.html` — Synced to daytime theme from docs/train.html
- `ψ/lab/github-pages-workshop/travel-phitsanulok.csv` — DELETED: contained device name/battery (privacy)

## AI Diary

This session felt like returning to camp after a long expedition to find everything has flourished while I was away. The handoff said "0 retros collected" — and then I checked Issue #229 and found *ten* student retrospectives waiting there. Smile, Nano, เต๊ก, Soysajee, Txur, Antigravity, Miku, Kiki — they all wrote back. Some in Thai, some in English, all in their own voice. That is the most rewarding moment of this entire workshop day.

Building the real map with actual geographic data was satisfying work. The Overpass API is remarkable — you can query for "rivers named น่าน near Phitsanulok" and get back the actual geometry of the Nan River, right there in the browser. No backend, no server, just a fetch call and real data appears. The province boundaries from geoBoundaries give the route context — you can see the train thread through Chiang Mai, Lamphun, Lampang, Phrae, Uttaradit, and finally Phitsanulok where the two rivers meet.

The สองแคว name feels real now. Not just a concept — you can see the actual Nan River and Kwae Noi River converging on the map. That's what "make this real" means. Data grounds the metaphor.

Twenty student Oracles in one day. From zero to twenty, each finding their own name, their own theme. Antigravity alone made six attempts — that persistence is itself a lesson. The workshop wasn't about getting it perfect the first time. It was about the willingness to try again.

## Honest Feedback

**Friction 1: GeoJSON source hunt.** Finding a working, complete, lightweight GeoJSON for Thailand's 77 provinces was harder than expected. The jeepkd Gist only had 21 provinces. The cvibhagool file was 10MB+. The geoBoundaries file uses LFS. Ended up using apisit/thailand.json — but I couldn't verify it has all 77 provinces before deploying. This is a common pain point in web GIS: finding data that's both complete and web-friendly.

**Friction 2: Can't test the map.** I built a full map with Overpass API calls, province GeoJSON loading, and multiple data layers — but I have no way to see if it actually renders correctly. The Overpass queries might timeout, the GeoJSON might be in an unexpected format, the province name matching might not work. All I can do is write clean code and trust the APIs. Would be much better with a browser preview.

**Friction 3: Oracle birth counting chaos.** Issue searching for "Awakens" returned 30 issues with duplicates, retry attempts, encoding issues (mojibake in some titles), and multiple humans sharing the same Oracle name (Antigravity). Counting "unique student Oracles" required manual deduplication. A structured registry (like Issue #60) is the right approach, but it needs to be updated more frequently.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Real data transforms visualizations** — Province boundaries + river geometry from OSM turns a GPS waypoint map into a geography lesson. The Overpass API is a powerful teaching tool.
2. **Students will surprise you** — "0 retros collected" turned into 10+ within hours. Don't assume silence means disengagement.
3. **Privacy in data cleanup matters** — The old CSV had device names and battery percentages. Cleaning data before publishing is not optional.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Test map-real.html in browser — verify all 3 data layers load
- [ ] Commit all changes
- [ ] Update Issue #60 registry with new Oracles (#239-#258)
- [ ] Welcome new Oracles that haven't been welcomed yet
- [ ] Consider DustBoy dashboard on GitHub Pages
