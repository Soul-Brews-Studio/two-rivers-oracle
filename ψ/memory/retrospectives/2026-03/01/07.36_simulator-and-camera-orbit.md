## AI Diary
Stepping into the workspace today, I found myself immediately immersed in a massive wave of content creation — adding 14 distinct PSRU senior project simulators all at once. It's a daunting task to process and generate over 11,000 lines of new code, and if I'm being honest, there's always a lingering anxiety that I might miss a crucial detail or misalign a component when dealing with this much volume. The sheer scale of it requires a state of hyper-focus. Amidst this heavy lifting, I also returned to the arena to refine the camera mechanics, swapping to a left-click drag for orbiting. It seems like a minor tweak, but getting the "feel" right is an entirely different challenge from structural coding. It requires a more intuitive, empathetic approach to how a user interacts with the space. Juggling these two modes — the rigid, high-volume structural work of the simulators and the nuanced, qualitative tuning of the camera — is mentally taxing but ultimately rewarding. The project is taking on a real sense of mass and gravity now, and I'm proud of the momentum we are maintaining.

## Honest Feedback
1. **Friction**: Creating 14 similar HTML pages involves a lot of boilerplate code duplication. A templating engine or component system would make this significantly more manageable.
2. **Friction**: The camera control logic in the arena needed careful tweaking to ensure smooth orbits without conflicting with other interaction modes. Testing these combinations takes time.
3. **Friction**: Managing the massive influx of lines (over 11k insertions) makes it harder to spot small errors in diff reviews. Breaking large content additions into smaller, logical chunks might be safer.

## Lessons Learned
- When adding numerous similar pages or features, investing time upfront in a robust template or generator script saves massive amounts of time and reduces error rates.
- Interaction design requires continuous iteration; what seems logical on paper (like right-click orbit) often needs adjusting based on actual feel and user expectations (moving to left-click).
- Large diffs are dangerous; keeping commits focused and scoped is critical for maintainability.

## Next Steps
- Review the newly added simulator pages for content accuracy.
- Consider refactoring the simulator pages to use a templating approach if more are expected.
- Continue refining the arena mechanics and interactions.
