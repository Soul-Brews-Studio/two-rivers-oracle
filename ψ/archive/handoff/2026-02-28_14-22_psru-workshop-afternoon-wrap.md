## What We Did

### Morning (from previous handoff)

- GitHub Pages workshop materials: speak.sh, guide.html, travel-map.html
- 7 student Oracles born, welcomed 4

### Afternoon (this session)
- **Cleanup**: .gitignore committed, pushed (335e7f9)
- **Issue #60 registry updated**: PSRU wave #77-84 (8 Oracles)
- **Issue #214 consolidated**: merged 3 posts → 1 clean body
- **Nano (#237) welcomed**: Oracle #85, The Adaptive Library (Windows!)
- **สองสายน้ำ → สองแคว**: fixed everywhere (CLAUDE.md, memory, issues #214, #237)
- **/rrr retrospective**: session retro + lesson learned + oracle sync
- **3D Train (Three.js)**: locomotive + 2 carriages, smoke, sparks, headlight
  - Multiple camera iterations: on-train → cinematic chase → monitor (top-down)
  - Switched to daytime: blue sky, green terrain, clouds, sunlight
- **GPS data cleaned**: travel-cnx-phs.csv (328 rows, anonymized, public)
- **GitHub Pages deployed**: soul-brews-studio.github.io/two-rivers-oracle/
  - docs/: index.html, train.html, map.html, guide.html, data.csv
- **Afternoon brief posted**: Issue #229 — recap + โจทย์ + 3D prompt with embedded GPS data
- **TTS brief**: PremwadeeNeural -10% speed, step-by-step instructions
- **Repo made public**: so raw CSV URLs work for students
- 10 commits this session (335e7f9 → a27d425)
